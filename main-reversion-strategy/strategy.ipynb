    "Mean Reversion Strategy With Moving Average\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we employ a simple mean reversion strategy with a 20-day simple moving average (SMA). The strategy assumes that if the stock price is below its moving average, it will eventually go up (mean reversion), and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Apple (AAPL) stock data, downloaded from Yahoo Finance. We'll calculate the 20-day SMA, create buy/sell signals, and plot the results.\n",
    "2. Data Download\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will import the necessary libraries and download the historical stock data for AAPL from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "import yfinance as yf\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define ticker and date range\n",
    "TICKER = \"AAPL\"\n",
    "START_DATE = \"2020-01-01\"\n",
    "END_DATE = \"2024-12-31\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Download the data\n",
    "data = yf.download(TICKER, start=START_DATE, end=END_DATE)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the columns of the downloaded data\n",
    "print(\"Columns after download:\")\n",
    "print(data.columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Moving Average Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the 20-day simple moving average (SMA) for the closing price of AAPL. This helps us track the price trend and identify mean reversion points.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the 20-day moving average\n",
    "MA_WINDOW = 20\n",
    "data['MA'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=MA_WINDOW).mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the first few rows of data with moving average\n",
    "print(\"First few rows after calculating 'MA':\")\n",
    "print(data[['Close', 'MA']].head(25))\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generating Buy and Sell Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create buy and sell signals based on the closing price and the moving average:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Buy signal: Generated when the price is below the moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sell signal: Generated when the price is above the moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also track the positions with a Position column indicating buy (1) or sell (-1) actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Drop rows with NaN values in 'MA' column\n",
    "data = data.dropna(subset=['MA'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the buy and sell signals\n",
    "data['Signal'] = (data['Close'] < data['MA']).astype(int)  # Buy when price is lower than the MA\n",
    "\n",
    "# Record position changes (1 for buy, -1 for sell)\n",
    "data['Position'] = data['Signal'].diff()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the signal and position data\n",
    "print(\"Buy and Sell Signals:\")\n",
    "print(data[['Close', 'MA', 'Signal', 'Position']].head(25))\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plotting the Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's plot the strategy by following:\n",
    "\n",
    "AAPL closing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Moving average (MA).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Buy signals as green arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sell signals as red arrows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot the strategy\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))\n",
    "plt.plot(data['Close'], label=\"Close Price\", alpha=0.5)\n",
    "plt.plot(data['MA'], label=f\"{MA_WINDOW}-day MA\", linestyle=\"--\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot buy signals\n",
    "plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == 1].index,\n",
    "         data['MA'][data['Position'] == 1],\n",
    "         \"^\", markersize=10, color='g', label='Buy Signal')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot sell signals\n",
    "plt.plot(data[data['Position'] == -1].index,\n",
    "         data['MA'][data['Position'] == -1],\n",
    "         \"v\", markersize=10, color='r', label='Sell Signal')\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.title(f\"{TICKER} Mean Reversion Strategy\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Date\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Price\")\n",
    "plt.grid(True)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Backtesting (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further backtest this strategy by calculating the returns earned by following the buy and sell signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Backtest the strategy by calculating daily returns\n",
    "data['Return'] = data['Close'].pct_change()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the returns of the strategy\n",
    "data='Strategy Return'] = data['Return'] * data['Signal'].shift(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cumulative returns\n",
    "data['Cumulative Return'] = (1 + data['Return']).cumprod()\n",
    "data['Cumulative Strategy Return'] = (1 + data['Strategy Return']).cumprod()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot cumulative returns\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))\n",
    "plt.plot(data['Cumulative Return'], label=\"Buy and Hold\")\n",
    "plt.plot(data['Cumulative Strategy Return'], label=\"Strategy\")\n",
    "plt.legend()\n",
    "plt.title(\"Cumulative Returns: Buy and Hold vs. Mean Reversion Strategy\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Date\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Cumulative Return\")\n",
    "plt.grid(True)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "    The strategy provides buy and sell signals based on the interaction between the price and the moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "By backtesting the strategy, we can compare its performance to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refinements in the future could include optimizing the window on the moving average or adding stop-loss and take-profit functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "When running this notebook, you will get:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The download of the AAPL stock data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculation of the 20-day moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generation of buy/sell signals based on the moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A plot of buy/sell signals, moving average, and stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A plot that compares the buy-and-hold strategy cumulative return with your mean reversion strategy cumulative return."
